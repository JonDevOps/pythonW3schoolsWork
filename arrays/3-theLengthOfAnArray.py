# The length of an Array
# Use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elemets in an array).

# Example 1
# Return the number of elements in the cars array:

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]

x = len(cars)

print(x)

# Note: The length of an array is always one more than the highest array index.
