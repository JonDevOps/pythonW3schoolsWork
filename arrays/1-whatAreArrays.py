cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]


# What is an array?
# An Array is a special variable, which can hold mor ethan one value at a time.
# If you have a list of items ( a list of car name, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

car1 = "Ford"
car2 = "Volvo"
car3 = "BMW"

# However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?
# The solution is an array!
# An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the valies by referring to an index number.
