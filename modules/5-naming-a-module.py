# Naming a module
# You can name the module file whatever you like, but it must have the file extension .py

# Re-naming a module
# You can create an alias when you import a module, by using the as keyword:

# Example
# Create an alias for mymodule.py called mx:
import mymodule as mx
a = mx.person1["age"]
print(a)
